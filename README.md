# Sprint V.3 Slutprojekt Mathias Wijk
My project is a Flutter mobile app that enables text translation to different languages and stores both the original and translated text in Firebase Firestore. It includes multiple pages for translating text to specific languages, such as English, Danish, Finnish and Swedish. The app's components consist of a homepage for language selection, individual translation pages with input fields and translation buttons, translation logic using the `translator` library, integration with Firebase Firestore for data storage, and a user interface created with Flutter widgets like `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `TextFormField`, and `ElevatedButton`.
